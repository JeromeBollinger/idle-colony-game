# Idle Colony Game

## Overview

This project aims to create a game that is inspired by oxygen not included from Klei Entertainment and Dwarf Fortress by Bay 12 Games. Thus this game aim to be a 2D colony management game combined with an idle game aspect of less failure prone and less management required.
For this I intend to use the bevy game engine which is entirely written in the Rust programming language.
There is no concrete Concept for this game but there are a few ideas I have.
I try to keep the concepts and ideas as low as possible since I don't have any experience in game development and only little in programming.

## Core Concept

The Game takes place on a planet or Asteroid where our colonists have to survive under ground due to space radiaton, asteroids or other threats. For the survival the colonists must use and manage several resources, like water (found as ice), oxygen, energy and construction materials. To manage these resources, our colonists have to discover resource patches by digging through the regolith, build machinery to harvest and refine these resources and lastly establish an environment where as many people as possible can survive in.

## future concepts

- temperature management
- colonists skills management
- morale
- sickness
- multiplayer trading system
- automation

## Gameplay

Likewise the gameplay is not clearly defined yet.
I imagine a top view of the map where the player defines some tasks by placing down the machinery blueprint and a colonist with free time will build it.
Also possible is that you are being the leader of a colony and have also the possibility to interact directly with the world.
This concept would be different from the two games I took inspiration from, where the interesting (or frustrating) part is that you are incapable of telling your duplicants or dwarfes what you intend to make and thus can get stuck under a boulder you wanted to remove.


## Art Concept

I would love to have a colleague working on this part, since I have neither the talent, creativity nor interest in making this.


## Tools

### Aseprite

[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) is nice for simple pixel art.
Easy to install on linux

### TexturePacker

[Texture packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) can be used to create spritesheets from a folder of images.
