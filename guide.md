# Contribution Guide

I wish I can create a game with some friends which are as motivated as me to create a game.
I am therefore open for all kinds of suggestions and although there are a few things that I decided and won't budge.
This would be that we use rust as programming language and that it is a 2D game.
Every other topic is discussable and I'd like you to challenge my approach and ideas.

## Working with git

I am aware that not everybody is familiar with git.
This is why I summarize the most important things in this document.
Git is a versioning tool, that lets you save changes to commits and branch changes into different branches.
As soon as your happy with your changes, you can add them to the main branch, which contains all approved changes.

If you want to contribute to this repository, create a new branch from the main branch with these commands
```
git checkout main
git create -b <branch name>
```

When you are done, push your branch to github. from there you can create a PullRequest.
This PullRequest has to be looked at from a different person before it is merged to main.
Usually this will be Jerome. (I currently can not enforce this, because I need premium for this)

> In general, make sure to checkout this [site](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
